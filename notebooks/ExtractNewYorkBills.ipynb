See how well that predicts other bills in the U.S. congress and use that model for the New York legislation. Go through a subset of the new york data and see if there are keywords or other information that can be used to hand label. Also, use the given terms to use as a broader base of keywords for labeling the U.S. data. Also, try running in an unsupervised setting to see how the data clusters."
